# GitLuv

Imagine being a lonely developer who is great at ReactNative but no one knows how awesome it is yet, so you can't find any work using it.  Imagine having the next Big Idea, but it would require this new language ReactNative that you just heard about but no one knows how to code in.  Imagine GitLuv making all these problems go away.
